# Multi Choice Platform
MCP was created to give interactive story authors flexbility in the platforms they choose to host their games. Platform lock-in leaves authors vulnerable to platform changes that may or may not benefit the author. This project is an attempt to help loosen that hold and allow authors to convert their stories between platforms.

# Goals
Initially, the goal is to allow conversion from ChoiceScript to Twine. We will see where this project takes us, but the MVP we hope to create will allow that initial conversion.
